# Ex.No: 12  Planning –  Monkey Banana Problem
### DATE:27/09/2025                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER :2122230402166
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Monkey Banana problem using PDDL Editor.
###  Algorithm:
Step 1:  Start the program <br> 
Step 2 : Create a domain for Monkey Banana Problem. <br> 
Step 3:  Create a domain by specifying predicates. <br> 
Step 4: Specify the actions GOTO, CLIMB, PUSH-BOX, GET-KNIFE, GRAB-BANANAS in Monkey Banana problem.<br>  
Step 5:   Define a problem for Monkey Banana problem.<br> 
Step 6:  Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 
Step 7: Stop the program.<br> 
### Program:
# domain.pddl
```
(define (domain monkey)
(:requirements :strips)
(:constants monkey box knife bananas glass waterfountain)
(:predicates (location ?x)
(on-floor)
(at ?m ?x)
(hasknife)
(onbox ?x)
(hasbananas)
(hasglass)
(haswater))
;; movement and climbing
(:action GO-TO
:parameters (?x ?y)
:precondition (and (location ?x) (location ?y) (on-floor) (at monkey ?y))
:effect (and (at monkey ?x) (not (at monkey ?y))))
(:action CLIMB
:parameters (?x)
:precondition (and (location ?x) (at box ?x) (at monkey ?x))
:effect (and (onbox ?x) (not (on-floor))))
(:action PUSH-BOX
:parameters (?x ?y)
:precondition (and (location ?x) (location ?y) (at box ?y) (at monkey ?y)
(on-floor))
:effect (and (at monkey ?x) (not (at monkey ?y))
(at box ?x) (not (at box ?y))))
;; getting bananas
(:action GET-KNIFE
:parameters (?y)
:precondition (and (location ?y) (at knife ?y) (at monkey ?y))
:effect (and (hasknife) (not (at knife ?y))))
(:action GRAB-BANANAS
:parameters (?y)
:precondition (and (location ?y) (hasknife)
(at bananas ?y) (onbox ?y))
:effect (hasbananas))
;; getting water
(:action PICKGLASS
:parameters (?y)
:precondition (and (location ?y) (at glass ?y) (at monkey ?y))
:effect (and (hasglass) (not (at glass ?y))))
(:action GETWATER
:parameters (?y)
:precondition (and (location ?y) (hasglass)
(at waterfountain ?y)
(at monkey ?y)
(onbox ?y))
:effect (haswater)))
```
### Input 
# problem.pddl
```
(define (problem pb1)
(:domain monkey)
(:objects p1 p2 p3 p4 bananas monkey box knife)
(:init (location p1)
(location p2)
(location p3)
(location p4)
(at monkey p1)
(on-floor)
(at box p2)
(at bananas p3)
(at knife p4)
)
(:goal (and (hasbananas)))
)
```
